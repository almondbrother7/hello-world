## hello-world
# This is the obligatory first file. I've been using gitHub for awhile now, but haven't bothered with my own repo.
<p>Some things you'll need to know about me</p>

* Love computer programming - lose track of time doing it (this is a good thing)
* Love dogs - taking care of one geriatric dog, which is a new challenge (also a good thing)
* SCUBA diving! (need say nothing more <-- ignore this)

At my new job, I'm learning [React](https://reactjs.org/)!  It is the most fun I've had programming, over 25 years now!

Also, learning *markdown* which is **fun** and super **_easy_**.
[working on an app for the boy scouts](link.to.be.published@here.com) which will also have a mobile component.

Here's a test logo (hover to see the title text):

---Here's some code:
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

| Cold, nasty      | Bahamas | SCUBA |
| Hot, sunny      | Dog Park      |   Dog |
| Rainy day | Computer      |   React! |

Block quote test:
> Why is it that some people don't know how to make a left turn at a light?  It is legal, actually encouraged behaviour, for you to enter the intersection in the left turn lane during the green light.  Don't worry, if traffic doesn't let up before the yellow light, when onconming traffic finally stops, it is your turn and you are legally ok to clear the intersection on a yellow (even a red light with Johnson Co, KS drivers oncoming) so complete your turn!  If you don't, you're liable to sit through one or two light cycles, and the drivers behind you will be forced to write something like this on a gitHub page.  By the way, keep your wheels pointing straight while you wait in the intersection.  This way, in case you are hit from behind, if / when your car lurches forward by the impact, you don't lurch into *oncoming traffic*!

You can use inline html:
<dl>
  <dt>Definition list</dt>
  <dd>Is something people use sometimes.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. Use HTML <em>tags</em>.</dd>
